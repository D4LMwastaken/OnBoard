# D4LM Hacker Card

<!-- Describe your board in 2-3 sentences. What are you making? What will it do? -->
I am making a hacker card that includes my information and a nfc reader that I can share with others. It can be read from the phone and has an LED.
<!-- How much is it going to cost? -->
$49.60 (why so much?)
<!-- Tell us a little bit about your design process. What were some challenges? What helped? ***Totally optional*** -->
For me the design process was a bit hard as though it says it was an easy project, it was quite hard. Some challenges I faced was that the tutorial will say a specific port and it is not there...
